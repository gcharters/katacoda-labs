## Starting and stopping the Open Liberty server in the background 

Although you can start and stop the server in the foreground by using the Maven `liberty:run-server` goal, you can also start and stop the server in the background with the Maven `liberty:start-server` and `liberty:stop-server` goals:

`mvn liberty:start-server`{{execute}}

`mvn liberty:stop-server`{{execute}}
